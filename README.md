# Bone-Fracture-Detection-using-Yolov7-ONNX-and-Yolov8-PyTorch-
A smart model that helps detect bone fractures from X-ray images. It uses two deep learning models YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 , shows their results side by side so doctors or researchers can easily compare speed and accuracy. Just upload an X-ray, and the system highlights possible fractures with confidence scores.
This project is built to help doctors and researchers detect bone fractures in X-ray images using Artificial Intelligence.
It compares two powerful deep learning models — YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 — side by side.

Just upload an X-ray, and the system will highlight possible fractures with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The goal is to make fracture detection faster, more reliable, and easier to use in real-world healthcare.

What it can do
	•	 Upload an X-ray image through a clean web interface.
	•	 Run both YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models on the same image.
	•	 See exactly where fractures are detected.
	•	 Compare the results of speed and accuracy between the two models.
	•	 Download the annotated images for reports or study.
Powered By
	•	Python + Streamlit (for the app)
	•	YOLOv7 (ONNX) for fast inference
	•	YOLOv8 (PyTorch) for high accuracy
	•	OpenCV & PIL for image processing
 How to use
	1.	Upload an X-ray image.
	2.	The system will process it and run predictions with both models.
	3.	You’ll see side-by-side results with detected fracture areas.
	4.	Download the final annotated images if needed.
 
 Why this project?
Fracture detection is time-consuming and sometimes small cracks are easy to miss.
This system provides a second pair of AI-powered eyes to support radiologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.
