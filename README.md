# Bone-Fracture-Detection-using-Yolov7-ONNX-and-Yolov8-PyTorch-
A smart model that helps detect bone fractures from X-ray images. It uses two deep learning models YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 , shows their results side by side so doctors or researchers can easily compare speed and accuracy. Just upload an X-ray, and the system highlights possible fractures with confidence scores.
